"""Garmin Coach plan curation, pinned to a real adaptive-plan payload.

The fixture below is the shape Garmin actually returned for an enrolled ATP
plan on 2026-09-19. Two things in it are load-bearing:

  * ``planName`` is None. Garmin does not name adaptive plans.
  * there is no ``trainingType`` key. Upstream read only that key, so it
    resolved to None, was dropped by the "strip None" filter, and the entire
    trainingPlanDetailsDTO -- the race goal included -- went with it. The tool
    could return nothing but an id and a classification.

Also covers get_gear_activities, whose tests previously shared a file with the
three training-plan tools removed in the same change.
